            <p class="text">Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge, learning new things about the surroundings and about oneâ€™s own self and making lots of great stories. Going for an adventure camp is the best way to get all of these as it forces one to get out of their ordinary lives and try new things.

                        The bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second Boer War, both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's march or "roll" through Malaya in World War II.

                    <h2 class="bgheader">PARAGLIDING</h2>
                </div>
                    <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paraglide: lightweight, freeflying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness
                        suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
                        entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the
                        outside.

                         First you have to take the parachute to the hill where you will make your jump. Be aware that the weight of parachute can vary between 6-15 kg. When you climb up the hill, all you need is a paragliding wing. As the paragliding pilot, you should be careful to make sure that the field is not obstructed by anything such as trees or structures. The paragliding pilot should run down the hill, and there is no need to run too fast because the wind will help enough already. The type of sports parachute used in paragliding is designed for easier take off and landing.

                    <h2 class="bgheader">SURFING</h2>
                </div>
                    <p class="text">Surfing is a feeling that is like no other, pushing up against a rolling wave while you coordinate power, direction, and balance. It takes patience, determination, and having your mind set on the goal: to master the waves. People can explain it to you, but diving in for the first time is what really gets my adrenaline and love for surf flowing. Until this day, the ocean is my playground, and surfing still gives me the same feeling of inspiration that I felt during my first encounter.
                      <br><br>
                      Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. Surfing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. It has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many rounds of the international surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually. Surfing is popular in Australia, the US, and Northern Europe.
